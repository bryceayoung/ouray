`r_workflows` primarily handles LAS files and creating rasters from those files.  
`utils` contains packages that I developed, mostly python functions that are packaged logically
`workflows` contains parcel-level risk assessment workflows in python. Primarily Jupyter Notebooks that are well-annotated. This includes handling vector and raster data with supervised and unsupervised learning.

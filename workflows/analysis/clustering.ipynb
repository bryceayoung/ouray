    "#### Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, I do two things: \n",
    "1. I use unsupervized learning models to cluster home types **without** risk score as a variable. I then draw comparisons between clusters and average risk scores. \n",
    "2. I use PCA and t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to derive home archetypes and test the reduced dataset with supervized risk prediction methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: It's possible that both the supervized and unsupervized methods can work together. The supervized method generates a risk score, then the clustering groups homes into archetypes, then we can go back and assign archetypes to homes and assess how many of those homes burned in historic fires such as Palisades, Lahaina, Marshall and Camp.*"

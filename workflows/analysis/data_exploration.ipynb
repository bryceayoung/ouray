    "#### Overview\n",
    "In the notebooks contained under the `data_prep` folder of this repository, we prepared raster, vector, and tabular data for analysis through extensive cleaning. In the `hiz` folder of this repository, the notebooks contain code for finding and summarizing raster values within the HIZ of each home, then appending that to the shapefiles. In this `analysis` folder, we finally get to see what the data is capable of producing.\n",
